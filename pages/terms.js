          as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,”

          Arbitration

        <Font variant="body1" fontWeight="bold" margin="2rem 0">
          Please read this section carefully. It affects rights that you may
          otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through
          arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is
          more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator
          instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration
          is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a
          court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination of these
          Terms.
        </Font>
        <Font variant="body1" margin="2rem 0">
          Binding Arbitration. This provision is intended to be interpreted
          broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating
          to these Terms, your use of the Sites, and your relationship with us.
          Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or use
          of the Sites and your relationship with BRUD Rewards or any
          subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in
          contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal
          theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of
          us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing
          by such a court.

        <Font variant="body1" margin="2rem 0">
          Arbitration Procedures. For all disputes, whether pursued in court or
          arbitration, you must first send a written description of your claim
          to our Customer Service department using the appropriate Contact Us
          link to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we
          each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may request
          arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60
          days.
        </Font>
        <Font variant="body1" margin="2rem 0">
          The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in
          accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association
          ("AAA"), including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as
          applicable), as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and information
          about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org. You
          and we agree that these Terms evidence a transaction in interstate
          commerce and that this arbitration provision will be interpreted and
          enforced in accordance with the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and
          federal arbitration law, and will not be governed by state law. Any
          arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient location in the
          state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. The
          arbitration will be conducted in the English language. An arbitrator
          may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in
          a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent
          required to satisfy your individual claim, and must follow and enforce
          these Terms as a court would. Any arbitration shall be confidential,
          and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results
          of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes
          of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration
          award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.

          Costs of Arbitration. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will
          pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the
          initial $200 filing fee, and for claims of less than $1,000, BRUD
          Rewards will reimburse you for the filing fee within 30 days of
          receiving a written request from you. Each party will bear the fees
          and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation
          and presentation of evidence at the arbitration. However, for claims
          under $10,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good
          faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the
          arbitrator finds you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you
          will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys’ fees and
          costs. Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to
          seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if an award is
          otherwise available under applicable law.

          Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver. You and we each agree that any
          proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only
          on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or
          representative action. If a court or arbitrator determines in an
          action between you and us that this class action waiver is
          unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If
          for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through
          arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.

          Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no
          applicability. If the arbitration agreement is ever deemed

          to arbitration, the User irrevocably consents to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Los Angeles County,
